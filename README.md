# Hungry-Snake project


The project consists of a simple Snake game . Here's a brief description :

Snake Game:

The Snake game is implemented using HTML5 and JavaScript.
It uses an HTML canvas element to render the game graphics.
The game includes a snake that the player controls using arrow keys.
The objective is to collect food items to increase the score while avoiding collisions with the canvas boundaries.
The game loop repeatedly updates the game state and redraws the graphics.
